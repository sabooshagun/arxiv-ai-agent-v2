# 🔎 Research Agent v5.0

A lightweight, intelligent research assistant that fetches, ranks, and explains recent AI papers from arXiv.

It runs fully in Streamlit and acts as a **"Universal Brain"** for research—you can plug in OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Groq to handle the reasoning, or run it entirely offline with a **Free Local Model**.

It produces ranked tables, citation impact scores, and **"Plain English" summaries** for the top papers.

## 🚀 What's New

### ⚾ The "Moneyball" Ranking Engine

We have completely overhauled how papers are ranked. We stopped asking LLMs to guess "Will this paper be famous?" (which turned out to be unreliable) and built a **Moneyball Algorithm**.

- **Hard Data (84% Weight):** The agent now queries Semantic Scholar to analyze the **"Author Velocity"** (recent citation momentum) of the paper's authors.
- **Soft Data (16% Weight):** The LLM analyzes the abstract for **"Market Fit"** (Is this a trending topic?) and **"Novelty."**

**The Result:** A **6x increase in precision@10**, meaning the papers at the top of your list are statistically much more likely to be influential.

### ⚡ Groq Integration (Llama 3.3)

You can now use **Groq** as your intelligence provider. This allows you to run high-performance open-source models (like **Llama 3.3 70B**) with blazing fast inference speeds and **free API access**.

> **Note:** In Groq mode, the agent uses local embeddings for search and the Groq LLM for reasoning.

### 🏷️ Smart Venue Filtering

Filter papers by publication venue without losing semantic quality:

- **Filter Types:** "All Conferences", "All Journals", or "Specific Venue"
- **Specific Selection:** Pick individual top-tier venues like **NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, Nature, or Science**
- **Smart Pipeline:** The agent performs semantic search on all papers first to understand the landscape, and then applies your venue filter. This ensures the AI sees the full context of related work before narrowing down.

### 🛡️ Robust arXiv Fetching

- Improved rate-limiting logic to strictly adhere to arXiv's API policies
- Prevents IP bans during large data fetches by using smart backoff (3-second delays)

## 🔌 Four Intelligence Modes

You can choose your **"Brain"** from the sidebar:

### 1. OpenAI Mode (Best Quality)

- **Requires:** OpenAI API Key
- **Models:** GPT-5.2, GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.0-mini, GPT-o1
- **Best For:** Highest quality reasoning, summaries, and narrative analysis. Uses OpenAI embeddings for search.

### 2. Gemini Mode (Best Context/Price)

- **Requires:** Google Gemini API Key
- **Models:** Gemini 3 Pro (Preview), Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Best For:** Processing large batches of papers quickly. Uses Gemini embeddings.

### 3. Groq Mode (Fastest / Open Source)

- **Requires:** Groq API Key (Currently Free)
- **Models:** Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 8B
- **Best For:** Fast speed and using open-weight models.
- **Architecture:** Uses Local Embeddings (MiniLM) for search + Groq for classification/scoring.

### 4. Free Local Mode (Offline / Privacy)

- **Requires:** No API Key. Runs on CPU.
- **Models:** SentenceTransformers (MiniLM-L6-v2) + Heuristics
- **Best For:** Offline use, zero cost, and quick browsing without LLM summaries.

## 🧠 How It Works (The Pipeline)

The agent follows a **9-step pipeline** to distill hundreds of papers into the top 3:

1. **Briefing:** You provide a natural language "Research Brief" (e.g., "Agents that use tool use") and optional constraints.

2. **Fetching:** It downloads recent metadata from **cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.HC** via the arXiv API.

3. **Semantic Search:**
   - **OpenAI/Gemini:** Uses cloud embeddings to find papers semantically similar to your brief.
   - **Groq/Local:** Uses local sentence-transformers (MiniLM) on your CPU to find relevant papers.

4. **Venue Filtering:** Filters candidates (e.g., "NeurIPS only") after the semantic search.

5. **LLM Classification:** The chosen LLM reads the abstracts and classifies papers as **Primary** (direct match), **Secondary** (partial match), or **Off-topic**.

6. **Scoring Set:** It builds a final list of ~20 papers to score, prioritizing Primary matches.

7. **Moneyball Scoring:** Instead of asking the LLM to guess citations, the agent fetches live Semantic Scholar data (**Author Momentum, Citation Velocity**) and combines it with an LLM analysis of **"Market Fit"** and **"Novelty"** to calculate a weighted Impact Score.

8. **Ranking:** Papers are ranked by this hybrid score.

9. **Reporting:** The UI displays metadata, PDF links, and generates a **Narrative Analysis** that explains why the paper is influential (e.g. "Backed by a powerhouse lab").

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Run Locally

This is a pure Python application. No Docker or complex databases required.

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nurtekinsavasai/arxiv-ai-agent-v2.git
cd arxiv-ai-agent-v2
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure you install groq if it wasn't automatically picked up
pip install groq
```

#### 4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🛠️ For Developers

- **`app.py`:** The entire application logic resides here. It is a single-file Streamlit app designed for portability.

- **Modifying Prompt Logic:** Look for the **Moneyball scoring functions** and `classify_papers_with_llm` in `app.py` to change how the AI judges papers.

- **Adding Providers:** The code uses a `LLMConfig` dataclass. To add a new provider (e.g., Anthropic), add the client initialization in `call_llm` and the specific embedding logic in `select_embedding_candidates`.
