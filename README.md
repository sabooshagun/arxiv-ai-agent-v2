# 📘 Research Agent v2

A lightweight research assistant that fetches, ranks, and explains recent AI papers from arXiv.
Runs fully in Streamlit, supports OpenAI or a free local model, and produces ranked tables plus top-N highlight summaries.

Now includes Human–Computer Interaction (cs.HC) in addition to cs.AI and cs.LG.

## 🚀 What's New in v2

### Two pipeline modes

You can run the system using:

#### 1. OpenAI Mode

Requires an OpenAI API key.
Enables the full experience:

- LLM-based relevance classification
- 1-year citation impact scoring using LLM judgment
- Plain English summaries of top papers
- Explanation factors for impact scores
- Higher-accuracy and more nuanced ranking

#### 2. Free Local Model Mode (Default)

Runs entirely locally on your machine.

- No API key needed
- Uses local embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Uses simple heuristic relevance + heuristic citation scoring
- Skips LLM summaries
- Still fetches and processes up to ~150 papers
- Great for quick browsing or for users without API access

Both modes share the same UI and the same pipeline.
Only the classification and scoring steps differ.

## 🧠 How It Works (Pipeline Overview)

Whether using OpenAI or free mode, the pipeline is:

### 1. You provide

- A short research brief
- Optional "not looking for" text
- A date window: Last 3 days, Last week, Last month

### 2. The agent fetches papers

It downloads recent papers from these categories:

- **cs.AI** – Artificial Intelligence
- **cs.LG** – Machine Learning
- **cs.HC** – Human–Computer Interaction

### 3. Candidate selection

- In **targeted mode**, it embeds the brief and abstracts then selects top-150 most similar
- In **global mode**, it simply takes the most recent 150

### 4. Relevance classification

- **OpenAI mode**: LLM assigns primary, secondary, or off-topic
- **Free mode**: heuristic based on embedding similarity

### 5. Citation scoring set

The agent:

- Keeps all primary papers
- Tops up with the strongest secondary papers until reaching ~20, when possible
- In global mode, uses all candidates

### 6. Citation impact scoring

- **OpenAI mode**: asks the LLM for a 1-year citation impact score and 3 explanation factors
- **Free mode**: derives a score from relevance and embedding similarity

These are impact signals, not predictions.

### 7. Ranking

- Primary papers ranked first by citation score
- Secondary papers follow
- Off-topic (rare) come last

### 8. Top-N highlighted papers

Displays:

- Metadata
- Links to PDF and arXiv
- Relevance reasoning
- Citation impact score
- Plain English summary (OpenAI mode only)

### 9. Export

A full Markdown report and all intermediate JSON files saved under:

```
~/arxiv_ai_digest_projects/project_<timestamp>
```

Downloadable as a ZIP from the UI.

## 💻 Running Locally (Only a UI — No backend server required)

**Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nurtekinsavasai/arxiv-ai-agent-v2.git
cd arxiv-ai-agent-v2
```

**Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser opens automatically.

## 🔌 Choosing a Provider (Sidebar)

### Option A — OpenAI

Select "OpenAI" and enter:

- API key
- Chat model (default: gpt-4.1-mini)

Enables full classification, scoring, explanations, and summaries.

### Option B — Free Local Model

Select "Free local model".

- No API key needed
- Uses CPU-only MiniLM embeddings
- Uses heuristic relevance + heuristic citation impact
- Slower but fully free
